I have completed the full frontend of my e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Now, I want to make it a complete working project using Django (Python) as the backend framework.

Please guide me step-by-step to:

Set up a Django project and connect it to my existing frontend files.

Create Django models for products, customers, and orders.

Implement user authentication (login/logout) for both customers and admin.

Handle order submission — when a customer places an order on the frontend, it should be saved in the Django database.

Create an Admin Dashboard (for my client) where they can view all orders.

Connect the frontend’s checkout form to the Django backend using AJAX or fetch() API calls.

Store uploaded product images properly and display them on the site.

Add payment gateway integration (like Razorpay or Stripe) later as an optional step.

Help me deploy the Django project (on Render / PythonAnywhere / Vercel / etc.) with my frontend working properly.

Assume I already have folders like /css, /js, /images, and multiple .html pages ready.
I want your response to include:

The folder structure of the Django project.

Where to put my existing frontend files.

All necessary Django commands and code snippets (models, views, URLs, etc.).

How to test and verify everything works together.

My goal:
➤ To make this e-commerce website fully functional with Django backend so that customers can place orders and my client can log in and see all customer orders in the dashboard.
