                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Founded in 2015, AquaPure emerged from a simple yet profound vision: to make clean, safe drinking water accessible to every household across the nation. What started as a small team of passionate engineers and water treatment specialists has grown into one of the leading manufacturers of RO water purification systems.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our journey began when our founder, recognizing the critical need for reliable water purification solutions in both urban and rural areas, decided to combine cutting-edge technology with affordable pricing. We understood that clean water isn't a luxury—it's a fundamental human right that should be available to everyone, regardless of their economic background.</p>
                    
                    <p>Over the years, we've continuously invested in research and development, working closely with water treatment experts, environmental scientists, and health professionals to create products that not only purify water but also retain essential minerals that are crucial for human health. Our commitment to innovation has led us to develop proprietary filtration technologies that set new industry standards.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, AquaPure serves over 500,000 satisfied customers across the country, from metropolitan cities to remote villages. Each installation represents not just a sale, but a step towards our ultimate goal: a world where every family has access to pure, healthy water straight from their tap.</p>
