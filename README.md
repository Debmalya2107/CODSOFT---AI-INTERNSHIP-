#  CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship

This repository contains the projects completed during my **Artificial Intelligence Internship** at **CodSoft** (Dec 15, 2025 – Jan 15, 2026).

The goal of this internship was to gain hands-on experience in **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Recommendation Algorithms**.

## Task 3: Image Captioning AI
Combine Computer Vision and NLP to generate captions for an input image.

### **Features**
* **Feature Extraction:** Uses **VGG16** (pre-trained on ImageNet) to extract visual features.
* **Sequence Processing:** Uses **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** to handle text sequences.
* **Web Interface:** A user-friendly **Flask** web app to upload images and get captions.
* **Dataset:** Trained on the **Flickr8k** dataset.

### **Tech Stack**
* Python, TensorFlow/Keras
* VGG16 (CNN), LSTM (RNN)
* Flask, HTML/CSS

---

## Task 4: Recommendation System
Create a system that suggests items to users based on similarities.

### **Approach**
* **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends items similar to those a user liked before (e.g., matching movie genres or book authors).
* **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends items liked by similar users (e.g., "Users who bought X also bought Y").

### **Tech Stack**
* Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
* Cosine Similarity, Matrix Factorization

---

## 👤 Task 5: Face Detection & Recognition
Develop an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos.

### **Approach**
* **Detection:** Uses **Haar Cascades** or **MTCNN** to locate faces in a frame.
* **Recognition:** Uses **LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms)** or deep learning embeddings to identify the specific person.

### **Tech Stack**
* Python, OpenCV
* Haar Cascades, Deep Learning models
